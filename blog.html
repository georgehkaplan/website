                    <h3>Mitchell International Internship</h3>
                    <em>Aug 2022</em>
                    <p>
                        Today I had internship presentation for Enlyte. This marks my last week as a Finance Department Intern with the company and now walking away with an experience that cannot be compared.<br>
                        <br>
                        As I wrap up my time here, I want to reflect on my experience. This internship allowed for my creative side as it was an idea that needed to come to life. I designed company pages to easily find documentation of all Mitchell AR processes. Throughout my internship, I met with various teams of the company and created an organized structure from scratch. I got to understand financial concepts of a large company and furthermore create an everlasting impact. The entire experience allowed myself to grow as a professional and grateful for each individual I met.<br>
                        <br>
                        I'd like to thank the entire team I worked with at Mitchell International including Daniel Lambeth, Jordan Banducci, Catherine Clark, Lillian Goldstein, Michael Lanci, and Kaitlyn McMurtray<br>
                        <br>
                        I am returning to San Diego State University this fall as a third-year to continue my studies and looking forward to growing both professionally and personally!
