                        <em>Aug 2022</em>
                        <p>Today I had internship presentation for Enlyte. This marks my last week as a Finance Department Intern with the company and now walking away with an experience that cannot be compared.</p>
                        <p>As I wrap up my time here, I want to reflect on my experience. This internship allowed for my creative side as it was an idea that needed to come to life. I designed company pages to easily find documentation of all Mitchell AR processes. Throughout my internship, I met with various teams of the company and created an organized structure from scratch. I got to understand financial concepts of a large company and furthermore create an everlasting impact. The entire experience allowed myself to grow as a professional and grateful for each individual I met.</p>
                        <p>I'd like to thank the entire team I worked with at Mitchell International including Daniel Lambeth, Jordan Banducci, Catherine Clark, Lillian Goldstein, Michael Lanci, and Kaitlyn McMurtray</p>
                        <p>I am returning to San Diego State University this fall as a third-year to continue my studies and looking forward to growing both professionally and personally!</p>

                        <p>This past friday was my last day with Better Buzz Coffee as a Shift Supervisor.</p>
                        <p>I am forever grateful for my time with the company. As this was my first job since the pandemic, it brought joy to my heart to be in a postive and welcoming environment. I was honored when I was asked to be promoted from a Barista to Shift Supervisor at such a young age. The relationships I have developed with the company and my team will stay with me as I continue my journey through life.</p>
                        <p>Thank you specifically to my manager, Katie Willis-Peña for the opportunity to work with you over the past year. As we say at Better Buzz, Life's Better Buzzed!</p>
