                <p>ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can be used to automate customer service, generate content, and more. It is a text-generating AI that can be trained to respond to any prompt. In this example, I will be using ChatGPT to generate a response to a customer service inquiry. <br>
                    <br>
                    The prompt is: <br><i>Customer: Hello, I am having trouble with my order. I ordered a pair of shoes and they have not arrived yet. <br>
                    <br> ChatGPT: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues with your order. To assist you effectively, could you please provide me with some additional details? Such as the order number, the name of the online store or company you ordered the shoes from, and any tracking information if available. This information will help me look into the situation and provide you with the most accurate guidance.</i>
